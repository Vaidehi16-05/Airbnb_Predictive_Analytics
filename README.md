# Airbnb_Predictive_Analytics

Airbnb hosts make money from renting out their properties; renters provide feedback by posting public ratings and comments
regarding their stay. Airbnb offers people an easy, relatively stress-free way to earn some income from their property. Guests often 
find Airbnb is cheaper, has more character, and is homier than hotels.

We tried six different models for our prediction. They are KNN, TREE, SVM,logistic regression, ridge lasso, and cross-validation.

The value of these predictions lies in empowering hosts and Airbnb's operations to make data-driven decisions. By leveraging these models, 
hosts can optimize their pricing strategies and increase their booking rates, while Airbnb can enhance customer satisfaction, prevent fraud, optimize business operations, and ultimately drive revenue growth for Airbnb and provide personalized experiences to its users.
These actions can lead Airbnb to improve revenue, increase customer loyalty, provide more personalized and efficient services to both guests 
and hosts, differentiate itself in the market, and stay ahead of the competition. The data we use to give all information from project pages are from Airbnb data. We utilized data, clean data, and to build and train different models that will most accurately predict the success of future projects. We can learn different information
